     * <h1>4cc = "{@value #TYPE}"</h1>
     * The sample table contains all the time and data indexing of the media samples in a track. Using the tables
     * here, it is possible to locate samples in time, determine their type (e.g. I-frame or not), and determine their
     * size, container, and offset into that container.  <br>
     * If the track that contains the Sample Table Box references no data, then the Sample Table Box does not need
     * to contain any sub-boxes (this is not a very useful media track).                                          <br>
     * If the track that the Sample Table Box is contained in does reference data, then the following sub-boxes are
     * required: Sample Description, Sample Size, Sample To Chunk, and Chunk Offset. Further, the Sample
     * Description Box shall contain at least one entry. A Sample Description Box is required because it contains the
     * data reference index field which indicates which Data Reference Box to use to retrieve the media samples.
     * Without the Sample Description, it is not possible to determine where the media samples are stored. The Sync
     * Sample Box is optional. If the Sync Sample Box is not present, all samples are sync samples.<br>
     * Annex A provides a narrative description of random access using the structures defined in the Sample Table
     * Box.
